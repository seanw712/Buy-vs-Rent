what went wrong here?

_**Assistant**_

This error is occurring because you're trying to install NumPy on Python 3.12, but there seems to be a compatibility issue. The specific error relates to `pkgutil.ImpImporter` which was removed in Python 3.12 as part of Python's modernization efforts.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Install a pre-built wheel instead of building from source:**
```bash
pip install --only-binary :all: numpy==1.24.3
```

2. **Use a newer version of NumPy** that's compatible with Python 3.12:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

3. **Use an older version of Python** (3.11 or earlier) if you specifically need NumPy 1.24.3.

The most straightforward solution would be option 2 - using a newer version of NumPy. The latest versions of NumPy are fully compatible with Python 3.12.

This issue occurs because NumPy 1.24.3 was released before Python 3.12 and wasn't designed to support it. The newer versions of NumPy have been updated to work with Python 3.12's changes.
