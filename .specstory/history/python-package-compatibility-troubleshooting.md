what does this mean?

_**Assistant**_

This error typically occurs when there's a compatibility issue between Python versions and package installations. The specific error `AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'` suggests that you're trying to use an older version of setuptools with a newer version of Python (likely Python 3.12 in your case, based on the file paths).

Here's what's happening:
1. The `ImpImporter` was removed in Python 3.12 as part of Python's modernization
2. Some older versions of setuptools and pkg_resources still try to use this removed feature

To fix this, you can try these solutions in order:

1. First, try upgrading pip and setuptools:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

2. If that doesn't work, try installing the package with the `--no-build-isolation` flag:
```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation package_name
```

3. If you're still having issues, you could try using an earlier version of Python (3.11 or earlier) for this project, as some packages might not yet be fully compatible with Python 3.12.

Could you share what package you're trying to install? That would help me provide more specific guidance.
