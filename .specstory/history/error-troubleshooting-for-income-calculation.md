I get this error:

_**Assistant**_

I notice you're getting a 400 error related to `monthly_disposable_income` calculation, but I don't have enough context to determine the exact cause. Could you please share:

1. The relevant parts of your `calculator.py` file, particularly the route handling the `/calculate` POST request
2. The form submission code from your frontend (likely in `static/script.js` or `templates/index.html`)

This would help me identify whether the error is coming from:
- Missing or invalid form data
- Calculation logic errors
- Data type conversion issues
- Form validation problems

Could you share those code sections?

what does this mean: alculation error: Error calculating scenarios: Error calculating rent scenario: 'ScenarioResults' object has no attribute 'monthly_savings_capacity'

Ah, I see the issue. In the `ScenarioResults` class's `__post_init__` method, there's a reference to `monthly_savings_capacity` which isn't defined in the class. This is causing the error. Let's fix it:

```python:calculator.py
// ... existing code ...

@dataclass
class ScenarioResults:
    """
    Represents the results of a scenario calculation.
    
    Attributes:
        principal_investment_value (float): Future value of initial investment.
        monthly_investment_value (float): Future value of monthly investments.
        house_value (float): Future value of the house (if applicable).
        remaining_mortgage (float): Remaining mortgage principal (if applicable).
        total_interest_paid (float): Total interest paid on mortgage (if applicable).
        total_rent_paid (float): Total rent paid over time (if applicable).
        monthly_mortgage_min (float): Minimum monthly mortgage payment.
        monthly_mortgage_max (float): Maximum monthly mortgage payment.
    """
    principal_investment_value: float = 0.0
    monthly_investment_value: float = 0.0
    house_value: float = 0.0
    remaining_mortgage: float = 0.0
    total_interest_paid: float = 0.0
    total_rent_paid: float = 0.0
    monthly_mortgage_min: float = 0.0
    monthly_mortgage_max: float = 0.0
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        """Ensure all values are initialized to at least 0.0"""
        self.principal_investment_value = self.principal_investment_value or 0.0
        self.monthly_investment_value = self.monthly_investment_value or 0.0  # Fixed this line
        self.house_value = self.house_value or 0.0
        self.remaining_mortgage = self.remaining_mortgage or 0.0
        self.total_interest_paid = self.total_interest_paid or 0.0
        self.total_rent_paid = self.total_rent_paid or 0.0
        self.monthly_mortgage_min = self.monthly_mortgage_min or 0.0
        self.monthly_mortgage_max = self.monthly_mortgage_max or 0.0

// ... existing code ...
```

The error occurred because in the `__post_init__` method, there was a line trying to initialize `self.monthly_savings_capacity`, but this attribute isn't defined in the class. I've replaced it with `self.monthly_investment_value` which is the correct attribute name as defined in the class.

This should resolve the calculation error you're seeing. The error was occurring because when initializing a new `ScenarioResults` object, it was trying to access a non-existent attribute.

When I try to edit the input fields, I can't anymore. Any reason for this?
