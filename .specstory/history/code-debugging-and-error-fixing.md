what's wrong with this code if anything?

_**Assistant**_

There are a couple of issues in the code that need to be fixed:

1. In the `net_worth` property definition, there's a syntax error. The `= 0.0` after the return type annotation is incorrect. Here's how to fix it:

```python:calculator.py
    @property
    def net_worth(self) -> float:  # Remove the "= 0.0"
        """Total net worth including all assets and liabilities."""
        try:
            return float(self.principal_investment_value + 
                        self.monthly_investment_value + 
                        self.house_value - 
                        self.remaining_mortgage)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Net worth calculation error: principal={self.principal_investment_value}, " +
                  f"monthly={self.monthly_investment_value}, " +
                  f"house={self.house_value}, " +
                  f"mortgage={self.remaining_mortgage}")
            return 0.0
```

2. The code includes a `calculate_future_value()` function in the snippets, but it's not being used in the main code. Instead, the code uses two separate functions: `calculate_future_value_principal()` and `calculate_future_value_monthly_investment()`. This isn't necessarily wrong, but you might want to consider consolidating these functions using the more robust `calculate_future_value()` implementation shown in the snippets.

3. While not strictly an error, the error handling in the code could be more specific. Many functions catch and re-raise generic Exceptions, which could mask the real source of problems. Consider catching specific exceptions (like ValueError, TypeError, etc.) where appropriate.

The main issue that needs to be fixed is the syntax error in the `net_worth` property. The other points are more about potential improvements rather than actual errors.
