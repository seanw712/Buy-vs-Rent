_**Assistant**_

This error occurs when trying to install a Python package and indicates that the `distutils` module is missing. This is a common issue with Python 3.12, as `distutils` was removed from the standard library.

To fix this, you have a few options:

1. The simplest solution is to install `setuptools` which includes `distutils`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

2. If that doesn't work, you can try installing the package you want with the `--no-build-isolation` flag:
```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation package_name
```

3. If you're still having issues, you might want to consider:
   - Using an earlier version of Python (3.11 or earlier) where `distutils` is still included
   - Creating a new virtual environment and trying the installation there
   - Upgrading pip to the latest version:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

Could you share what package you were trying to install when you got this error? That might help me provide a more specific solution.
