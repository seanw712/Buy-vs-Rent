how to reset from git

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll explain the common git reset commands and their use cases:

1. **Soft Reset** - Keeps your changes but undoes the commit
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit but keep changes staged
```

2. **Mixed Reset** (Default) - Keeps your changes but unstages them
```bash
git reset HEAD~1        # Undo last commit and unstage changes
# or
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```

3. **Hard Reset** - Completely removes changes (⚠️ Be careful - this deletes work!)
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove last commit and all changes
```

Some other useful reset commands:

4. **Reset to specific commit**
```bash
git reset <commit-hash>  # Reset to specific commit
```

5. **Reset a specific file**
```bash
git reset HEAD filename  # Unstage a specific file
```

6. **Reset to remote branch state**
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main  # Reset to match remote main branch
```

Common parameters:
- `HEAD~1`: Go back 1 commit
- `HEAD~2`: Go back 2 commits
- `<commit-hash>`: Reset to specific commit hash

⚠️ **Important Notes**:
- `--hard` reset is destructive and cannot be undone
- If you've pushed commits to remote, you'll need to force push after a reset
- It's good practice to create a backup branch before doing major resets

If you want to undo a reset, you can use:
```bash
git reflog  # Find the commit hash you want to return to
git reset --hard <commit-hash>  # Go back to that commit
```

Explain the calculator codebase to me in pseudocode that keeps the logic but makes it understandable for a non-coder.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here's a high-level explanation of the calculator's logic in pseudocode:

```pseudocode
CALCULATOR STRUCTURE:

1. Input Collection (ScenarioInputs class):
   - Collect financial parameters:
     • Initial savings
     • House cost
     • Monthly rent
     • Monthly disposable income
     • Time period (in years)
     • Mortgage length
     • Growth rates (house prices, investments, mortgage rate, inflation)
   
   - Validate all inputs:
     • Ensure numbers are positive where needed
     • Check if rates are realistic (<20%)
     • Verify there's enough savings for down payment
     • Convert text inputs to numbers

2. Results Storage (ScenarioResults class):
   - Track key financial outcomes:
     • Investment values (from initial savings and monthly investments)
     • House value
     • Remaining mortgage
     • Total interest paid
     • Total rent paid
     • Monthly mortgage payments (min and max)
   
   - Calculate net worth:
     Net Worth = Investments + House Value - Remaining Mortgage

3. Core Calculations:
   
   Calculate Future Investment Value:
   - Take initial amount
   - Apply compound interest formula: Amount × (1 + rate)^years
   
   Calculate Mortgage Payment:
   - Use standard mortgage formula: Payment = Principal × (rate × (1 + rate)^months) / ((1 + rate)^months - 1)
   - If no interest, simply divide principal by months
   
   Calculate Monthly Investment Growth:
   - Start with monthly disposable income
   - Subtract housing costs (rent or mortgage)
   - Invest the difference each month
   - Account for:
     • Income growing with inflation
     • Rent growing with inflation
     • Mortgage staying fixed

4. Three Main Scenarios:

   RENT Scenario:
   - Grow initial savings through investments
   - Calculate rent payments (increasing with inflation)
   - Invest difference between income and rent
   - Track total rent paid

   MAX MORTGAGE Scenario:
   - Use minimum down payment
   - Take largest possible mortgage
   - Calculate fixed mortgage payments
   - Invest remaining savings and monthly surplus
   - Track house value growth

   MIN MORTGAGE Scenario:
   - Use maximum down payment (from savings)
   - Take smallest possible mortgage
   - Calculate fixed mortgage payments
   - Invest remaining savings and monthly surplus
   - Track house value growth

5. Comparison:
   - Run all three scenarios
   - Return results for comparison:
     • Final net worth
     • Total costs (rent or mortgage interest)
     • Investment growth
     • House value (if applicable)
```

The calculator essentially answers the question: "Should I rent and invest the difference, or buy a house with either a minimum or maximum mortgage?"

It considers:
- The opportunity cost of using savings for a down payment
- The difference between rent (which increases) and mortgage payments (which stay fixed)
- House value appreciation
- Investment returns on savings
- The impact of inflation on income and rent

The results help compare the long-term financial outcomes of each approach, considering both wealth building (through investments and/or house equity) and costs (rent or mortgage interest).

What are the requirements for the scenarioinputs class?

---

_**Assistant**_



Here are the requirements for the ScenarioInputs class, broken down into required inputs and validation rules:

```pseudocode
REQUIRED INPUTS:
1. Mandatory Parameters (must be provided):
   • initial_savings: float        - Starting amount of money saved
   • house_cost: float            - Purchase price of the house
   • monthly_rent: float          - Monthly rent payment
   • monthly_disposable_income: float - Monthly money available after essential expenses
   • time_horizon_years: int      - How many years to calculate for
   • mortgage_term_years: int     - Length of mortgage

2. Optional Parameters (have default values):
   • house_inflation: float       - Annual house price growth rate
   • investment_return: float     - Annual investment return rate
   • mortgage_rate: float         - Annual mortgage interest rate
   • min_down_payment_percent: float - Minimum down payment as decimal (e.g., 0.20 = 20%)
   • cpi: float                   - Consumer Price Index (inflation rate)

VALIDATION RULES:
1. Time Periods:
   • time_horizon_years must be > 0
   • mortgage_term_years must be > 0
   • mortgage_term_years cannot exceed time_horizon_years

2. Financial Values:
   • house_cost must be > 0
   • monthly_rent must be >= 0
   • monthly_disposable_income must be > 0
   • initial_savings must be >= 0

3. Rate Limits:
   • All rates must be >= 0:
     - house_inflation
     - investment_return
     - mortgage_rate
     - cpi
   • All rates must be <= 0.20 (20%):
     - house_inflation
     - investment_return
     - mortgage_rate
     - cpi

4. Down Payment:
   • min_down_payment_percent must be between 0 and 1
   • initial_savings must be sufficient to cover minimum down payment:
     - Minimum required = house_cost × (1 + purchase_fees) × min_down_payment_percent
     - initial_savings must be >= Minimum required

5. Type Conversion:
   • All inputs are converted to appropriate numeric types:
     - Integers for year values
     - Floats for all other values
```

Example usage:
```python
# Valid inputs
inputs = ScenarioInputs(
    initial_savings=50000,
    house_cost=300000,
    monthly_rent=1500,
    monthly_disposable_income=3000,
    time_horizon_years=30,
    mortgage_term_years=25,
    house_inflation=0.03,     # 3%
    investment_return=0.07,   # 7%
    mortgage_rate=0.045,      # 4.5%
    min_down_payment_percent=0.20,  # 20%
    cpi=0.02                  # 2%
)

# These would raise ValueError:
invalid_inputs = ScenarioInputs(
    initial_savings=-1000,            # Error: Cannot be negative
    house_cost=0,                     # Error: Must be positive
    monthly_rent=-500,                # Error: Cannot be negative
    monthly_disposable_income=0,      # Error: Must be positive
    time_horizon_years=0,             # Error: Must be positive
    mortgage_term_years=40,           # Error: Cannot exceed time_horizon
    house_inflation=0.25,             # Error: Too high (>20%)
    investment_return=0.30,           # Error: Too high (>20%)
    mortgage_rate=-0.01,              # Error: Cannot be negative
    min_down_payment_percent=1.5,     # Error: Must be between 0 and 1
    cpi=0.25                         # Error: Too high (>20%)
)
```

All these requirements ensure that the calculator operates with realistic and valid inputs to provide meaningful comparisons between renting and buying scenarios.

Which of the attached files deliver the input values and through what mechanism?

---

_**Assistant**_

The input values flow through these files in the following way:

1. **Default Values Source** (`config.py`):
```python
# Provides the default/initial values for all inputs
DEFAULT_INITIAL_SAVINGS = 50000
DEFAULT_HOUSE_COST = 200000
DEFAULT_MONTHLY_RENT = 650
# ... etc
```

2. **HTML Form** (`templates/index.html`):
```html
<!-- Displays the form fields with default values from config.py -->
<input type="number" class="form-control" id="initial_savings" 
       value="{{ config.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SAVINGS }}" required>
<input type="number" class="form-control" id="house_cost" 
       value="{{ config.DEFAULT_HOUSE_COST }}" required>
<!-- ... etc -->
```

3. **JavaScript Collection** (`static/script.js`):
```javascript
// Collects values when form is submitted
function getFormData() {
    const formData = {
        initial_savings: parseFloat(document.getElementById('initial_savings').value),
        house_cost: parseFloat(document.getElementById('house_cost').value),
        // ... etc
    };
    return formData;
}

// Sends to backend via POST request
document.getElementById('calculatorForm').addEventListener('submit', async function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = getFormData();
    const response = await fetch('/calculate', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    });
```

The flow is:
1. `config.py` defines default values
2. Flask template renders these defaults into the HTML form
3. User can modify values in the form
4. On form submit, JavaScript collects all values and sends them to the backend
5. Backend receives the values through the `/calculate` endpoint

The key mechanisms are:
- Jinja2 templating (`{{ config.DEFAULT_* }}`) to get defaults into HTML
- HTML form inputs to capture user values
- JavaScript form submission to collect and send data
- Fetch API to transmit data to backend
