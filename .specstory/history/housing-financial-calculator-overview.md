This is a Python script that appears to be a financial calculator, specifically for comparing different housing scenarios: renting vs. buying a house with different mortgage options.

The main components are:

1. `ScenarioInputs` class: Stores and validates input parameters like:
   - Initial savings
   - House cost
   - Monthly rent
   - Monthly savings capacity
   - Various rates (mortgage, investment return, inflation)

2. `ScenarioResults` class: Stores calculation results including:
   - Investment values
   - House value
   - Mortgage details
   - Total interest/rent paid
   - Net worth calculations

3. Key calculation functions:
   - `calculate_rent_scenario()`: Calculates outcomes if you rent and invest
   - `calculate_buy_scenario()`: Calculates outcomes if you buy a house
   - `compare_scenarios()`: Compares three scenarios:
     - Renting
     - Buying with maximum mortgage
     - Buying with minimum mortgage

The calculator takes into account various factors like:
- House price inflation
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Investment returns
- Mortgage rates
- Purchase costs/fees

It's designed to help users make an informed decision between renting and buying by showing the long-term financial implications of each choice.
