## Code Review: Mortgage Calculation Issues (2/1/2025, 1:50:37 PM)

_**User**_

Is there something wrong with this code?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, there's a potential issue in the code. The default values for both `time_horizon_years` and `mortgage_term_years` are set to `cfg.DEFAULT_MORTGAGE_TERM_YEARS`. While this might be intentional, it's usually better to have the time horizon be independent of the mortgage term, as they serve different purposes:

- `time_horizon_years` represents how far into the future you want to calculate the scenarios
- `mortgage_term_years` represents the length of the mortgage loan

Here's how I would suggest modifying the code:

```python:calculator.py
// ... existing code ...
    time_horizon_years: int = cfg.DEFAULT_TIME_HORIZON_YEARS  # Changed to use a separate default
    mortgage_term_years: int = cfg.DEFAULT_MORTGAGE_TERM_YEARS
// ... existing code ...
```

You would need to add a new constant `DEFAULT_TIME_HORIZON_YEARS` in your config file. This makes the code more flexible and clearer in its intent, allowing users to set different default values for the time horizon and mortgage term.

For example, you might want a 30-year time horizon to compare scenarios, even if you're looking at a 25-year mortgage term. With the current setup, they're always defaulting to the same value, which might not be the desired behavior.

I want to create a variable that depicts the monthly amount available for saving (after all costs deducted incl. rent). How to call it?

ForI'll help you add a variable to track the monthly savings amount. We should add it to the `ScenarioResults` class since it's a calculation result. Here's how to modify the code:

```python:calculator.py
@dataclass
class ScenarioResults:
    """
    Represents the results of a scenario calculation.
    
    Attributes:
        principal_investment_value (float): Future value of initial investment.
        monthly_investment_value (float): Future value of monthly investments.
        house_value (float): Future value of the house (if applicable).
        remaining_mortgage (float): Remaining mortgage principal (if applicable).
        total_interest_paid (float): Total interest paid on mortgage (if applicable).
        total_rent_paid (float): Total rent paid over time (if applicable).
        monthly_mortgage_min (float): Minimum monthly mortgage payment.
        monthly_mortgage_max (float): Maximum monthly mortgage payment.
        monthly_savings (float): Monthly amount available for saving after housing costs.
    """
    principal_investment_value: float = 0.0
    monthly_investment_value: float = 0.0
    house_value: float = 0.0
    remaining_mortgage: float = 0.0
    total_interest_paid: float = 0.0
    total_rent_paid: float = 0.0
    monthly_mortgage_min: float = 0.0
    monthly_mortgage_max: float = 0.0
    monthly_savings: float = 0.0  # Added new field
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        """Ensure all values are initialized to at least 0.0"""
        // ... existing code ...
        self.monthly_savings = self.monthly_savings or 0.0  # Added initialization
```

Then update the scenario calculation functions to include this value:

```python:calculator.py
def calculate_rent_scenario(inputs: ScenarioInputs) -> ScenarioResults:
    """Calculate results for rent and invest scenario."""
    // ... existing code ...
    
    return ScenarioResults(
        principal_investment_value=principal_growth,
        monthly_investment_value=monthly_growth,
        total_rent_paid=total_rent,
        monthly_savings=inputs.monthly_disposable_income - inputs.monthly_rent  # Added monthly savings
    )

def calculate_buy_scenario(inputs: ScenarioInputs, max_mortgage=True) -> ScenarioResults:
    """Calculate results for buying scenario."""
    // ... existing code ...
    
    return ScenarioResults(
        principal_investment_value=principal_growth,
        monthly_investment_value=monthly_growth,
        house_value=future_house_value,
        remaining_mortgage=remaining_mortgage,
        total_interest_paid=total_interest,
        monthly_mortgage_min=min_monthly_payment,
        monthly_mortgage_max=max_monthly_payment,
        monthly_savings=inputs.monthly_disposable_income - monthly_payment  # Added monthly savings
    )
```

This will track how much money is available for saving each month after deducting either rent or mortgage payments. Note that this is the initial monthly savings amount - in reality, both income and rent would typically increase with inflation over time, while mortgage payments usually remain fixed (unless it's an adjustable-rate mortgage).

What if the input (through the html form) is given in the form of monthly_savings_capacity. For the purpose of the calculation we use monthly_disposable_income (which adds monthly_rent to the montlhy_savings_cap). Where should I define this monthly_disposable_income? How would I edit this in the calculator file? Explain using pseudocode for non-coders.

---

_**Assistant**_



I understand you want to work backwards from the user's monthly savings capacity to calculate the monthly disposable income. Here's the logic in plain English:

1. User inputs their monthly_savings_capacity (how much they can save after paying rent)
2. We know their current monthly_rent
3. Therefore: monthly_disposable_income = monthly_savings_capacity + monthly_rent

Here's how to modify the code:

```python:calculator.py
@dataclass
class ScenarioInputs:
    """Input parameters for scenario calculations."""
    initial_savings: float
    house_cost: float
    monthly_rent: float
    monthly_savings_capacity: float  # Changed from monthly_disposable_income
    purchase_costs: float = cfg.DEFAULT_HOUSE_PURCHASE_FEES_PERCENT
    // ... existing code ...

    @property
    def monthly_disposable_income(self) -> float:
        """Calculate total monthly disposable income by adding rent to savings capacity."""
        return self.monthly_savings_capacity + self.monthly_rent

    def validate(self):
        """
        Validate input values to prevent calculation errors.
        """
        // ... existing code ...
        self.monthly_savings_capacity = float(self.monthly_savings_capacity)  # Changed from monthly_disposable_income
        
        if self.monthly_savings_capacity <= 0:  # Changed validation
            raise ValueError("Monthly savings capacity must be positive.")
        // ... rest of existing validation code ...
```

In pseudocode, here's what's happening:
```
Class ScenarioInputs:
    Required inputs from user:
        - initial_savings (how much money they have saved)
        - house_cost (cost of house they want to buy)
        - monthly_rent (what they currently pay in rent)
        - monthly_savings_capacity (how much they can save after paying rent)
        ... other inputs ...

    Calculate monthly_disposable_income:
        monthly_disposable_income = monthly_savings_capacity + monthly_rent
        
    This means:
    If someone pays $1000 in rent and can save $500 per month,
    their monthly_disposable_income would be $1500
```

The rest of your calculator code can remain unchanged because it will use the calculated `monthly_disposable_income` property instead of requiring it as a direct input. This makes the form more intuitive for users since they typically know how much they can save after paying rent, rather than their total disposable income.

The main changes are:
1. Rename the input field from monthly_disposable_income to monthly_savings_capacity
2. Add a property that calculates monthly_disposable_income
3. Update the validation to check monthly_savings_capacity instead

This way, your HTML form can ask for monthly_savings_capacity, but your calculations can still work with monthly_disposable_income internally.

Can you explain what def & property mean here? Why can't I just define the variable under scenarioinputs or results?

---

_**Assistant**_



Let me explain the difference between a regular variable and a `@property` in Python using a simple analogy:

1. Regular variable (static value):
```python
@dataclass
class ScenarioInputs:
    monthly_savings_capacity: float
    monthly_rent: float
    monthly_disposable_income: float  # Regular variable
```
This is like writing a number in stone. Once set, it stays the same unless explicitly changed. If rent or savings capacity changes, monthly_disposable_income won't automatically update.

2. Property (calculated value):
```python
@dataclass
class ScenarioInputs:
    monthly_savings_capacity: float
    monthly_rent: float
    
    @property  # This makes it a "smart" variable
    def monthly_disposable_income(self) -> float:
        return self.monthly_savings_capacity + self.monthly_rent
```
This is like a calculator formula. Whenever you check monthly_disposable_income, it recalculates based on the current values of savings_capacity and rent. It's "dynamic" - always up to date.

Here's a real-world example:
```python
# With regular variables:
inputs = ScenarioInputs(
    monthly_savings_capacity=500,
    monthly_rent=1000,
    monthly_disposable_income=1500  # We have to calculate this ourselves
)
inputs.monthly_rent = 1200  # If rent changes
# monthly_disposable_income is still 1500 (wrong!)

# With @property:
inputs = ScenarioInputs(
    monthly_savings_capacity=500,
    monthly_rent=1000
)
print(inputs.monthly_disposable_income)  # Shows 1500
inputs.monthly_rent = 1200  # If rent changes
print(inputs.monthly_disposable_income)  # Shows 1700 (automatically updated!)
```

The `def` keyword in Python is used to define a function or method. In this case, we're defining a method that calculates monthly_disposable_income whenever it's needed.

Using a `@property` is better here because:
1. It ensures monthly_disposable_income is always correct
2. You can't accidentally set it to the wrong value
3. It reduces duplicate data (DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself)
4. It makes the code more maintainable

I get a calculaton error for monthly_disposable_income, any reasons you see in this file?

_**Assistant**_



Looking at the code, I notice that in the `validate()` method, there's a line trying to convert `monthly_disposable_income` directly, which could cause an error since it's a property (calculated value) and not a direct input field. Here's the problematic part and how to fix it:

```python:calculator.py
def validate(self):
    """
    Validate input values to prevent calculation errors.
    """
    // ... existing code ...
    self.monthly_rent = float(self.monthly_rent)
    self.monthly_savings_capacity = float(self.monthly_savings_capacity)
    self.monthly_disposable_income = float(self.monthly_disposable_income)  # Remove this line - can't convert a property
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if self.monthly_disposable_income <= 0:  # This check is fine to keep
        raise ValueError("Monthly disposable income must be positive.")
```

The error occurs because we're trying to convert and reassign a property value, which isn't possible. Since `monthly_disposable_income` is automatically calculated from `monthly_savings_capacity` and `monthly_rent`, we only need to validate those input values.

The property will automatically use the converted values when calculating `monthly_disposable_income`. You don't need to explicitly convert the property itself.

This should resolve the calculation error while maintaining all the validation checks you need.
