## Flask Installation Troubleshooting (1/22/2025, 11:05:01 PM)

what does this mean?

_**Assistant**_

This error means that the Flask web framework is not installed in your Python environment. Flask is a Python library used for building web applications, and it seems your project is trying to use it but it's not available.

To fix this, you need to install Flask using pip (Python's package installer). Open your terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install flask
```

I notice that your README.md mentions a `requirements.txt` file, but it seems you might be trying to run `app.py` directly without installing the dependencies first. You should:

1. Either install Flask directly as shown above, or
2. Follow the README instructions and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This second option will install all the required dependencies listed in your requirements.txt file, not just Flask.

After installing Flask, you should be able to run your application without the ModuleNotFoundError.

Also, I notice the README mentions running `python main.py`, but you're trying to run `app.py`. Make sure you're running the correct file as specified in the documentation.
