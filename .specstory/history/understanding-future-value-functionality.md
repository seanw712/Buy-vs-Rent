## Understanding Future Value Functionality (1/26/2025, 11:02:38 PM)

_**User**_

Is this function only used to output the future value of the principal, or also for monthly payments? I think there is another function for that, no?

_**Assistant**_

Looking through the code, the `calculate_future_value()` function is actually used to calculate the future value of BOTH the initial principal AND monthly payments combined. It does this in two parts:

1. Calculates future value of the initial principal:
```python
fv_principal = max(0, principal * (1 + annual_rate) ** years)
```

2. Calculates future value of all monthly payments:
```python
if abs(monthly_rate) < 1e-10:  # Effectively zero rate
    fv_payments = monthly_payment * n_months
else:
    # ... calculates compound interest on monthly payments ...
```

The function then returns the sum of both parts: `fv_principal + fv_payments`

You might be thinking of `calculate_investment_growth_with_varying_contributions()`, which is a different function that handles a more complex scenario where the monthly contributions can change over time (e.g., due to inflation). That function actually ends up being used in both the rent and buy scenarios to calculate investment growth when monthly contributions might vary year over year.

The key difference is:
- `calculate_future_value()`: Assumes constant monthly payments
- `calculate_investment_growth_with_varying_contributions()`: Handles varying monthly payments that change with inflation

However, looking at the code, it appears `calculate_future_value()` isn't directly called anywhere in the current file. It might be used elsewhere in the project, or it could potentially be deprecated in favor of the more flexible `calculate_investment_growth_with_varying_contributions()` function.
